              It was great to feel challenged and motivated to 'move' more. I am
              on the road to better habits and I’m really grateful. I really
              appreciate the time you spent making sure we succeeded in a way
              that was important for each of us.

              Derek helped me develop my ‘keystone habits.’ Simple practices
              done daily that seemed almost inconsequential at the time..those,
              combined behavior tracking through wearable tech have kept 60lbs
              off for the last three years.

              LifeUP provided a framework for both food and workout that I know
              I can just wake up and do without thinking about it, which helps
