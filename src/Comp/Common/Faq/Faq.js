                  The first step is to diligently reflect on your company’s
                  values. A healthy corporate culture is strongly tied to its
                  core principles and beliefs – and it applies from the
                  corporate office on down. Success means employees being able
                  to connect to these values, or else your efforts to build a
                  workplace wellbeing culture could be doomed to failure.
                  Consider how a corporate wellness culture aligns with current
                  company values. Read over your company’s mission and vision
                  statements, then create vision and mission statements for this
                  new project and what you plan to achieve for company health.

                  How can you enlist the enthusiastic participation of senior
                  executives and managers? How about your employee health
                  champions? What do they each know so far? What gaps in their
                  awareness do you need to address? You could handle all this in
                  your HR department, but it makes more sense to bring other
                  people in now, ideally from every organizational level. By
                  establishing, supporting, and maintaining a Worksite Wellness
                  Committee, you’ll provide opportunities for leadership,
                  management, and staff to:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Foster collaboration</li>
                    <li>
                      Establish robust cross-level/department lines of
                      communication
                    </li>
                    <li>Create your new culture of health!</li>
                  </ul>
                  So, who’s going to serve on your new Workplace Wellness
                  Committee? Lots of questions! Find the checklist and

                  This is information you’ll need to assess the success of any
                  programs you implement and establish a baseline to determine
                  ROI. Then you’ll take the pulse of your organization. Any
                  successful health initiatives start with getting feedback from
                  your people. Use surveys and focus groups to get a clearer
                  view of demographics and learn what employees expect. Take
                  care to include a representative sample of your people across
                  generational, racial, sexual orientation/gender identity
                  (SOGI) lines to gauge a realistic idea of what wellness
                  represents to the whole organization. After you’ve carefully
                  listened, communicate the things you learned to your employees
                  and the steps you intend to take to begin creating a culture
                  of health in the workplace. Throughout any survey process,
                  INSURE CONFIDENTIALITY.

                  The most effective wellness programs measure success in two
                  ways: Return on Investment (ROI) and Value on Investment
                  (VOI). These are the only ways to ensure that your health
                  initiatives bear fruit. Because as Peter Drucker also famously
                  quipped, “Only what gets measured gets managed.” What do you
                  measure currently? What else could you measure?
